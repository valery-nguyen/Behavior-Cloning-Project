# Behavior-Cloning-Project for Self-Driving Cars

Please take a look at the demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8ejrQ8Ew5U)

Using Keras, I have built a convolution neural network that predicts steering angles from images.
I have trained and validated the model, and tested the model which successfully drives around the track.
